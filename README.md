Currently in a development stage.

Follow the steps to get a build up and running:
  1. `cd` into the swift folder, and run `swift build`
  2. `cd` into the electron folder, and run `npm install`
  3. From the same folder (electron) do `npm run start` and the application should appear in your Mac tray.

Enjoy!
